## Research project: Effect of Cholestasis
Welcome to the repository for our research project on the effect of cholestasis on mRNA and miRNA expression in liver tissue. 

## Project description
**Background:** Cholestasis is characterized by accumulation of toxic bile in the liver. However, it is unclear how the liver adapts to cholestatic conditions. This study aims to elucidate how hepatic tissue reacts to  cholestatic conditions on a transcriptomic level. <br/>
**Methods:** Cholestatic, preoperatively drained and control tissues were analyzed to investigate transcriptomic differences. Both mRNA and miRNA data was processed and analyzed using a classical differential gene expression approach. Based on a FDR of 5% and absolute fold changes greater than 1.5, significantly different expressed genes were selected. Subsequently gene ontology enrichment and pathway enrichment analysis were combined with protein-protein interaction network construction to identify underlying biological mechanisms by which hepatic tissue adjusts to cholestatic conditions. <br/>
**Results:** It was found that drainage contributed largely to normalizing gene expression relatively to control subjectsâ€™ gene expression profiles. Furthermore three main biological processes and pathways, namely bile secretion, extracellular matrix organization and inflammatory response, were found to have different gene expression levels in cholestatic subjects compared to control subjects. Accordingly, it was found that miRNA hsa-34a-5p which effects pro-apoptotic and pro-inflammatory genes was upregulated in cholestatic subjects. Interestingly it was found that OPN/SPP1 which is involved in ECM as well as neutrophil leukocyte attraction was highly upregulated. <br/>
**Conclusion:** Thus we hypothesize an underlying interplay between ECM re-organization, inflammatory response and hsa-34-5p upregulation in cholestasis. Research into this field will help elucidate the underlying mechanism of cholestasis and potentially lead to novel therapeutic strategies.
